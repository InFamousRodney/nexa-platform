# Salesforce OAuth Testing Issues

## Implementation Overview

### Core Components
1. `initiateSalesforceAuth` function
   - Handles Salesforce OAuth initiation
   - Returns authorization URL
   - Implements typed error handling with `SFAuthError`

2. `ConnectOrgButton` Component
   - Uses React Query for mutation state management
   - Implements loading states and error handling
   - Shows toast notifications for different error types

### Current Error Types
```typescript
interface SFAuthError {
  errorCode: string;  // 'INVALID_RESPONSE' | 'SUPABASE_ERROR' | 'UNEXPECTED_ERROR'
  errorMessage: string;
}
```

## Testing Issues

### 1. Button Disabled State
```typescript
// Test Failure
expect(button).toBeDisabled();
// Error: Received element is not disabled
```

**Analysis:**
- Button has correct CSS classes: `disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50`
- Missing HTML `disabled` attribute
- Potential issue with React Query's `isPending` state propagation

### 2. Async Test Environment
```typescript
// Error in all async tests
TypeError: Expected container to be an Element, a Document or 
  a DocumentFragment but got undefined
```

**Analysis:**
- Occurs in all tests using `waitFor`
- Suggests React Query context issues
- Possible test cleanup timing problems

## Questions for Review

1. **React Query Setup**
   - Is the test environment correctly configured for async mutations?
   - Should we use a different approach for managing query client in tests?

2. **Component Implementation**
   - Is `isPending` being handled correctly in the button component?
   - Should we implement additional loading state checks?

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Are we following best practices for testing async React components?
   - Do we need to modify our test utilities for better async support?

## Next Steps

1. Review React Query's documentation on testing mutations
2. Investigate button disabled state implementation
3. Consider refactoring test utilities for better async support

## Additional Notes

- All synchronous tests pass successfully
- Error handling implementation is working as expected
- Toast notifications are properly configured but not testable due to async issues
